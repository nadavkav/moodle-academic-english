CUL Upcoming Events block
=========================
The block displays the displays future events in a summarized list. The number of days in advance is hard coded to 365 but this will be added as a block setting in a future version.

Events are generated directly from the calendar and/or activity deadlines, providing a link to full details or
directly to the activity.

There are also links to Go to calendar... and add a New Event....

The block is based on the core Moodle Upcoming Events Block but is styled like a feed to match the CUL Activity Feed
Block.

RC Version 2 adds dynamic scrolling and updating of the events.
