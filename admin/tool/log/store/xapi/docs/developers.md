This page contains documentation for developers (people who would like to contribute code to the project).

- [Release process](#release-process)

## Setup
From the root directory of your Moodle installation run the script below.
```sh
cd admin/tool/log/store; rm -rf xapi; git clone git@github.com:jlowe64/moodle-logstore_xapi.git xapi; php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php; rm -rf vendor; php composer.phar install --prefer-source;
```

If you hadn't already installed the plugin, you'll need to login as an admin and navigate to "http://www.example.com/admin/index.php" (replacing “www.example.com” with your own domain). Once there you can follow on from step 6 of the [user installation guide](installation.md).

## Adding Events
Assuming you've followed the [instructions above](#setup), you can modify and test events by updating the code inside the directories below.

- vendor/learninglocker/moodle-log-expander
- vendor/learninglocker/moodle-xapi-translator
- vendor/learninglocker/xapi-recipe-emitter

If you've read the [plugin design](design.md) you should understand what each of these directories are responsible for. Each of the parts have their own documentation on their respective Github repositories (linked below).
